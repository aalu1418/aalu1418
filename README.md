# Aaron Lu - @aalu1418

Hello! 👋🏼   
My name is Aaron and welcome to my github page. I am an aerospace engineer + software developer, but I am fascinated by all things technology. My focus in the aerospace sector is mainly with control systems and algorithms, and in software development: web dev and decentralized tech. 

I am currently working at [Conflux Network](http://confluxnetwork.org) on building out the decentralized technology space, and in my spare time I'm always looking for projects and ideas to tinker with.
